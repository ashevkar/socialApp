# ‚ú® Orkut Social App (Next.js) ‚ú®

This is a web application built with Next.js, inspired by social platforms like Orkut. It allows users to sign up, log in, post messages, view a feed, like messages, and manage their profile. üöÄ

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application uses the Next.js App Router structure.

* **üñ•Ô∏è Frontend:** Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. Components handle UI elements like the tweet feed, individual tweet cards, login/signup forms, profile pages, etc. Client-side logic interacts with the backend API to fetch data and perform actions.
* **üî© Backend (API):** Implemented using Next.js Route Handlers within the `src/app/api/` directory. These handlers define endpoints for various actions.
* **üîí Authentication:** Handled by NextAuth.js using a Credentials provider (email/password). Session management uses JWTs, secured by the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
* **üíæ Database:** Prisma acts as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with the database. It defines the schema (User, Tweet, Like, Comment, Follow) and provides tools for database migrations and queries. The database itself is likely PostgreSQL.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Data Flow / User Experience

This section describes the typical journey a user takes through the application:

1.  **üîë Authentication:**
    * A new visitor typically lands on the login page.
    * If they don't have an account, they can navigate to the Sign Up page to register (`Create` User operation ‚ú®).
    * After signing up, or if they already have an account, they Log In using their credentials (`Read` User operation for verification ‚úîÔ∏è). NextAuth.js handles session creation.
2.  **üì∞ Core Interaction (Logged In):**
    * Upon successful login, the user is usually directed to the main feed.
    * **Feed:** The user can view a list of recent tweets from various users (`Read` Tweet operation üëÄ).
    * **Tweeting:** The user can create their own tweets using a text input/form (`Create` Tweet operation ‚úçÔ∏è). The new tweet appears in the feed.
    * **Tweet Management:** Users can delete their own tweets (`Delete` Tweet operation üóëÔ∏è).
    * **Liking:** Users can like or unlike any tweet in the feed (`Create`/`Delete` Like operation ‚ù§Ô∏è).
3.  **üë§ Profile Management:**
    * Users can navigate to their profile page (`Read` User operation).
    * They can edit their profile information, such as adding or updating their bio, name, or profile picture (`Update` User operation ‚úèÔ∏è).
4.  **üîî Notifications:**
    * The notification section allows users to see who has liked their tweets (`Read` Like operation üëç).
    * It also shows mentions where other users have tagged them in tweets (`Read` Tweet operation üó£Ô∏è).
5.  **‚öôÔ∏è Settings:**
    * In the settings area, users can change their account password (`Update` User operation üîê).
    * Users also have the option to permanently delete their account and all associated data (`Delete` User operation ‚ùå).
6.  **üëã Logout:**
    * Users can log out of their account, which clears their session via NextAuth.js.

The application demonstrates **CRUD (Create ‚ûï, Read üëÄ, Update üîÑ, Delete ‚ùå)** operations for key entities like Users and Tweets through these user interactions, managed via API requests to the Next.js backend and interactions with the Prisma ORM and the database.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites üîß

* Node.js (>= 18.18 recommended for Next.js 15)
* npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
* Access to a PostgreSQL database instance.

### Installation & Setup üì¶

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install, pnpm install, bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:** ‚öôÔ∏è
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    * Add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values:
        ```env
        # Example .env file
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public" # Your PostgreSQL connection string
        NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_HERE" # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
        NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # For development
        ```

4.  **Apply database migrations:** üõ†Ô∏è
    * Ensure your database server is running and accessible.
    * Run Prisma migrations:
        ```bash
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```
    * (Optional) Seed the database: `npx prisma db seed` (if you create a seed script).
